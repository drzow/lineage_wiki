## Device Bootloader Unlockable

Some Android devices are bootloader locked by the carrier or manufacturer and cannot be unlocked.
This is distinct from carrier locking; a device may be carrier unlocked allowing it to be used with
any carrier while still having its bootloader locked.
LineageOS requires the device to be unlocked in order to install LineageOS.

### Why is that?

Carriers and manufacturers may lock the bootloader on devices to prevent the installation of
alternative firmware, either to ensure that the device can only run Android, or to prevent the
use of alternative firmware to use a different carrier.
